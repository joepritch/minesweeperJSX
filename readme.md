## Notes

I decided to clone my minesweeper game in React because I felt that it was the most interesting Angular project I made (with the exception of my group project). Though it is currently unfinished, and does not have multiple pages, I feel that it still utilizes the most of Angular's features out of all of my projects, and will require the most effort in converting to React. This also presents me with the challenge of finishing the Angular version of this project before next Friday, which I feel will give me more valuable practice in Angular and prevent me from becoming 'rusty'.

Unforeseen issues:

Development Differences:

  The Angular version of this project relied on a lot of Angular-specific code such as ngFor, ngClass, and adding click functions directly into the html.
